[![latest](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/amancevice/docker-superset/latest.yml?branch=main&label=latest&logo=github&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/amancevice/docker-superset/actions/workflows/latest.yml)

Docker image for [Superset](https://github.com/ApacheInfra/superset).

This project is unofficial and not related to Superset or Apache.

## Download

Download this image from the Docker registry:

```bash
docker pull amancevice/superset:<version>
```

## Building

I **DO NOT** recommend building this image directly from the Dockerfile included in this repository.

If you wish to extend this image then the best course of action is to write your own Dockerfile that extends this image. Eg,

```Dockerfile
FROM amancevice/superset:<version>
USER root
# Your changes...
USER superset
```

## Issues

Please **ONLY** file issues in this project that are related to Docker and **DO** include the Docker commands or compose configuration of your setup when filing issues (be sure to hide any secrets/passwords before submitting).

File issues/bugs with Superset at the [source](https://github.com/apache/superset).

Please **DO NOT** files issues like "Please include `<some-python-pip>` in the Dockerfile," open a [pull request](https://github.com/amancevice/superset/pulls) for updates/enhancements.

## Examples

Navigate to the [`examples`](./examples) directory to view examples of how to configure Superset with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

## Versions

This repo is tagged in parallel with superset. Pulling `amancevice/superset:0.18.5` will fetch the image of this repository running superset version `0.18.5`. It is possible that the `latest` tag includes new features/support libraries but will usually be in sync with the latest semantic version.

## Configuration

Follow the [instructions](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#configuration) provided by Apache Superset for writing your own `superset_config.py`. Place this file in a local directory and mount this directory to `/etc/superset` inside the container. This location is included in the image's `PYTHONPATH`. Mounting this file to a different location is possible, but it will need to be in the `PYTHONPATH`.

View the contents of the [`examples`](./examples) directory to see some simple `superset_config.py` samples.

## Volumes

The image defines two data volumes: one for mounting configuration into the container, and one for data (logs, SQLite DBs, &c).

The configuration volume is located alternatively at `/etc/superset` or `/home/superset`; either is acceptable. Both of these directories are included in the `PYTHONPATH` of the image. Mount any configuration (specifically the `superset_config.py` file) here to have it read by the app on startup.

The data volume is located at `/var/lib/superset` and it is where you would mount your SQLite file (if you are using that as your backend), or a volume to collect any logs that are routed there. This location is used as the value of the `SUPERSET_HOME` environmental variable.

## Database Initialization

After starting the Superset server, initialize the database with an admin user and Superset tables using the `superset-init` helper script:

```bash
docker run --detach --name superset [options] amancevice/superset
docker exec -it superset superset-init
```

## Upgrading

Upgrading to a newer version of superset can be accomplished by re-pulling `amancevice/superset`at a specified superset version or `latest` (see above for more on this). Remove the old container and re-deploy, making sure to use the correct environmental configuration. Finally, ensure the superset database is migrated up to the head:

```bash
# Pull desired version
docker pull amancevice/superset

# Remove the current container
docker rm -f superset-old

# Deploy a new container ...
docker run --detach --name superset-new [options] amancevice/superset

# Upgrade the DB
docker exec superset-new superset db upgrade

# Sync the base permissions
docker exec superset-new superset init
```
